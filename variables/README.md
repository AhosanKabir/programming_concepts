## what is Variable ?
---

A **variable** in programming is a named storage location that holds a value or data.  
These values can change during the execution of a program, hence the term **"variable."**  
Variables are essential for storing and manipulating data in computer programs.

Variables can hold different types of data, such as:
- Whole numbers (integers)
- Decimal numbers (floats/doubles)
- Text (strings)


## Variable Rules
---
1. Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
2. They cannot start with a number.
3. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_`).
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different).
5. Avoid using reserved keywords (like `if`, `for`, `while`) as variable names.
